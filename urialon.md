{{1-3}} > Anyone can give a good talk.

{{2-3}}  [[Yes]] Yes
         [[No]] No
    
{{3-5}} > All researchers should be trained in the basics of giving talks, to the great benefit of their research programs and the audience

{{4-5}}  [[None][Low][Some][High]]
         [                       ] researchers
         [                       ] lecturers
         [                       ] students
         [                       ] me


{{5}} > The three principles of a good talk areas follows:
{{6-9}} >> Preparation
{{7-9}} >> Presentation
{{8-9}} >> Questions

{{10}} > Goal: Let your inner glow and insights shine out

## Preparation

{{1-5}}  finding the main idea you want to get across

{{2-5}} > the premise

{{3-5}} > A premise is a single sentence with a subject, an object and verb.

{{4-5}} [( )] Cell shape and the cytoskeleton
        [(X)] Cells change their shape by regulating their cyto-skeleton

{{5-6}} The talk should contain only material that is relevant to the premise. Leave out cool, interesting stuff if unrelated to premise.

{{6-8}} > Title each slide with its own premise

{{7-8}} > The title (premise) of the slide helps the audience grasp the idea of the slide in a glance

{{8-10}} [( )] What happens to the number of cells?
         [( )] An assay of cell number
         [(X)] The number of cells increases with time

{{9-10}}![Bild](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1097276509007424-gr2.jpg)

{{10}} > Finding the premise of your slides should be considered an integral part of your research.

{{11}} > Each slide should contain only one premise. Otherwise break it down to two.

{{12}} > Experimental Data should be used lightly

{{13}} > Learn the first two to three sentences by heart

{{14}} > Focus on a nice introduction

{{15}} > Remember how much the audience doesn't know.

## Presentation

{{1}} A good presentation is a two-way communication --> ***Make eye contact***, don't bury yourself in your slides

{{2}} Look at one person for one sentence.

{{3-4}} ![Bild](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1097276509007424-gr3.jpg)

{{4}} Remember the audience wants you to succeed in giving an enjoyable talk.

{{5}} Eye contact enables you to see if the audience is with you. If they are not, it enables you to adjust.

{{6}} As you grow more proficient, try to build drama over arc of the talk, by sharing how your research originated from your sense of wonder about the topic.

{{7}} Body language is also important for good communication, avoid a contorted position:
       shoulder turned to audience, eyes on his/her own slides, and arms crossed holding a laser pointer in one hand and changing slides with the other.

{{8}} >Most people find, after an initial awkwardness, that open body language makes them feel better than closed body language.

{{9}} Guide your audience through the results of your research

{{10}}[( )] Do you understand?
      [(X)] Did I explain myself?

{{11}} > --> You place responsibility for clarity on yourself

## Question

> Questions are a precious opportunity to get feedback on your research.

{{1}} > Make eye contact with the questioners

{{2}} > Repeat the question in their words so everyone can hear it.

{{3}} > Check the eyes to see if you got the meaning.

{{4}} >> If not, ask for more context.

{{5}} > Accept the question is worthwhile

{{6}} > Answer the content, not the tone of the question.


{{7}} > The first question is very important, because the way that you answer it will set the frame for the next questions.

{{8}} > Take questions as suggestion for the next talk --> Preparation

## Overcoming Stage Fright

{{1}} Almost **everyone** has stage fright.

{{2}} Stage fright: the fear that the audience will judge you, find you at fault, and throw you out of the community

{{3}} Stage fright **makes you:**

{{4}} > overprepare and write every word on the slides, try to accumulate all possible information,
{{4}} > freeze and delay preparing

{{5}} > Stage fright begins when you are assigned the task of giving a presentation.
