## Basics

### Principles

** There are three principles for a good talk **

*Based on "How to give a good talk" by Uri Alon (in Molecular Cell, 2009)*

+ Preparation

  + Title each slide with a full sentence, the premise of the slide.

+ Presentation

  + Make eye contact with your audience, rather than with your own slides.

+ Questions

  + Listen to the question, repeat to see if you got it, and answer its contents, not its tone.

{{1}} > The aim is not marketing but to let your inner glow and insights out.

### Premise of the presentation

** Find a main idea for your presentation - a premise. **

*This must be done before you start making the slides*

+ Describe the premise of the entire talk in a single sentence with:

  + a subject, (an object) and a verb

+ A premise for the presentation could be this:

  + Cells change their shape by regulating their cytoskeleton

+ The following is not a premise:

  + Cell shape and the cytoskeleton. Why?

+ The premise is your compass for what to include.

{{1}} > The presentation should only include material that is relevant to the premise

### Premise of the slides

** The title of each slide is premise **

*A premise is single sentence with a subject, (an object) and a verb*

+ Sentence

  + The number of cells increase with time

+ Question

  + What happens to the number of cells?

+ Fragment

  + An essay of cell number

+ Each slide should only have one premise

  + And only data relevant to this premise

{{1}}> The title of the slides helps the audience understand the idea of the slide in a glance

### Eye contact

** A presentation is two-way Communication **

*To do this make eye contact with the audience*

+ Make eye contact with the one member of the audience for one sentence and then with another
+ Eye contact connects you to your audience

  + You can see if they understand you

  + You can modify your presentation spontaneously

+ Body language is important for good communication

  + We'll talk about this later

+ You are responsible for guiding the audience through your research

  + Do say: Did I explain myself

  + Don't say: Do you understand
