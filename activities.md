# Ball game

**Aim:**
- to learn each other's names
- to cooperate ahead of other activities
- to break the ice at the beginning
**Materials:** ball for each group
Two groups of 8 participants stand in a circle. One person starts with the ball. He says a name and throws the ball to that person, but not to the person next to him/her. The next person says a name and throws the ball to that person. Finally the ball gets to back to the first person. The groups repeat this, getting faster and faster and I time them to see which group is faster. Then they find ways of going even faster (eg. by moving closer together)
**Discussion:** Did you work well together? Is it important to know names?

# Alphabetical names

**Aim:** To test whether names have been learnt. To learn names from the other group.

**Materials:** None

Each group lines up in alphabetical order of first names from left to right. Then all participants line up.

**Note:** For communicating, a name is very important Use but don't overuse!

# Experience/Expectations

**Aim:** To bring to mind specific situations participants have had relating to positive or negative experiences of giving presentations (what about watching presentations/ being an audience member?). To focus on what the participants expect from the workshop.

**Materials:** Moderation Cards (3 Colours)

Participants roleplay being at a social gathering. They find (a) partner and ask each other the questions:

- Tell me about a positive experience of presenting you have had?  
- Tell me about a negative experience of presenting you have had?
- What do you expect from this workshop?

They discuss one question with a partner and write down his/her answers. When I clap my hands they find new partners and move on to the next question. When all three points have been discussed, participants stick their cards to a board and discuss all together. Cards for question 3 are put on the left-hand side of the expectations board. (To be moved at the end of the day)

Spiel kann mit diesen Break out rooms bei BBB gemacht werden. Also immer zwei zusammen. Mit den Sammeln der Ideen ist ein wenig schwierig. Man könnte sie in einem Dokument sammeln und dieses als Hauptscreen beim Gruppencall aneigen.

# Communication brainstorm

**Aim:** For participants to consider what they mean by communicate and to consider all aspects of communication.

**Material:**
slide flipchart, paper and pens

![Mindmap](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/png/ZP71QeKm44Nt-Og1BeCfnPKGH6ef_OEkfneqD9afCK6azDyhcatJ1y_bFVTm4vXkYHYYjpHw_19wYPiphSZvnU8KqCEt053EueTBvWW0ppXyJe4JZJqx3l1GDyrJKn_TArCywJhRQ7Rs8_HZdXOIUlO-aHqmMYRGEY-thP0ItcUC1PEWbFhl6Rhe1ND5B96eAdZZzG-hCdDCqyt2fs4kYlq7M-cMZvqQtzKwGsE-pIy0)

Improve on this mind map!

Participants have 15 minutes to get ideas (with a partner but first on their own for 5 minutes)

- 5 minutes - alone
- 5 minutes - with a partner
- 5 minutes - create the mindmap together

Before we do this we'll have discussed the slide on the definition of communication.



# Giving presentations

**Aim:** For participants to show how they give presentations and to get feedback on the main issues.

**Materials:** Projector and laptop. Pens/paper.

Participant take in turns to give a shot presentation (2 or 5 min) with one question allowed at the end. The others evaluate the presentations using a simple evaluation sheet (given by me). On the back of the sheet there is space to write down the points that are important when giving a presentation.

Ist auch gut online möglich. Ich glaube das Problem ist ein bisschen die Erstellung der Mini-presentations. Man könnte vorher vorbereitette nehmen. Es gibt auch das Spiel Powerpoint Karaoke. Man bekommt eine Präsentation ohne das Thema zu kennen und muss dann aus dem Stegreif einen Vortag halten. Weiss aber nicht wie gut das wirklich ist oder mehr als Auflockerung. Habe nur Sachen auf Deutsch gefunden. Aber kann auch auf Google bei so klassischen Themen und .ptt etwas finden.

- my feedback
# Brainstorming good presentations

**Aim:** For the participants to share and distil their own views on what makes a good presentation.

**Materials:** flipchart sheet, Pens

Working in groups of 3, participants get their ideas down on a flipchart sheet. They then hang up their sheets around the room.

- everyone has the time (possibility at lunchtime) to look at all the flipchart sheets
- Plenary discussion about the ideas

# Presentation basic activities

**~~Activity 1~~**
**Aim:** To practice the material I present to the participants on the principles of giving a good presentation.
**Materials:** A printout version of the participants presentation

Participants go through their presentations and identify a "premise" for the whole talk and premise for each slide.  

**~~Activity 2~~**
**Aim:** To acclimatise participants to eye contact
**Materials:** 2 chairs opposite each other. With a partner, participants look into each others eyes for one minute. Afterwards we discuss how this was for them.

# Voice activities

**~~A breathing exercise~~**
**Aim:** For the participants to become aware of their breath. For the participants to practise speaking from their bellies.

**Materials:** None (maybe a slide with a picture on it)
Participants all stand up facing me. I give them instructions to stand up straight and breathe in. Ask them what happens when they breath in. Where can they feel the breath? Where can they feel the body move? Put a hand on your belly. Breath and feel the belly rise. Breathe in and feel the belly rise. Breathe out and feel it sink. Practice this for a couple of minutes.

- Breathe in to chest
- Breathe in to mouth
- Breathe up and down. How does it feel?
- Making noises on the out breathe. How does it feel?
- -> Making very loud noises on the out breathe.
- Reading something out
- -> out from belly
- -> out from chest
- -> from the throat
- Which feels best?

**~~A volume exercise~~**
**Aim:** For participants to practise varying the volume of their voice and to become aware of their voice volume.
- Reading out sentences loudly and quietly. (pair work)

**~~A prosody exercise~~**
**Aim:** To get used to saying things in different ways.
- Read the sentences with different feelings.

**Note::**
Pros = towards
Aoide = a song
**Prosody** the patterns of stress and intonation in a language
**Intonation** the sound pattern of phrases and sentences produced by pitch variation in the voice.
