# Ball game

# Alphabetical names

# Experience/Expectations

**Aim:** To bring to mind specific sitautions participants have had relating to positive or negative experieneces of giving presentations (what about watching presentations/ being an audience member?). To focus on what the participants expect from the workshop.

**Materials:** Moderation Cards (3 Colours)

Participants roleplay being at a social gathering. They find (a) partner and ask each other the questions:

- Tell me about a positive experience of presenting you have had?  
- Tell me about a negative experience of presenting you have had?
- What do you expect from this workshop?

They discuss one question with a partner and write down his/her answers. When I clap my hands they find new partners and move on to the next question. When all three points have been discussed, participants stick their cards to a board and discuss all together. Cards for question 3 are put on the left-hand side of the expectations board. (To be moved at the end of the day)
